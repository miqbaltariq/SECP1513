On November 2, we had a lab class for Technology and Information System where we had to take apart a pc and then reassembled it. We were taken to the lab and seperated into groups and each group had to disassemble a PC. Then, we were told to compete on which group gets to re-assemble the PC the fastest and successfully make it turn on. Afterwards, we had a quiz on the topic to check our understanding of the topic. I like that we had such a hands on experience dealing with the computer hardware. As computer science students, it lets us closely get used to the different components of PC hardware and familiarizes us with assesmbling it so that it works. I look forward to similar lab classes in the future as it was a fun experience
