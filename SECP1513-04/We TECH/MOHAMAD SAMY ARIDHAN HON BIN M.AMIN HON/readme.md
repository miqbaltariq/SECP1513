| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | Reflection 1 <br> Personally, my favorite speaker is Mr Yee in this talk. I admire his passion and interest in his work, and that’s what pushes him to success. He always welcomes challenges as he sees it as an opportunity to learn even more, and for him, learning never stops. I aspire to be like him. Other than that, he gives great advice on what kind of worker we should be so that companies like Clarity Techwork see values in us. He emphasizes that you should start working on yourself right now, not after you graduate, that would be too late. Also, self-learning is the most important skill out of all, since there isn’t always someone who can teach you, especially after you stop into the working field. I hold the advice dearly as I believe that is the key for me to be successful in the future.| 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | Reflection 2 <br> The industry visit was a good pace change with course mates after studying all week. Not only did we have fun exploring, we also gained knowledge of what it’s like in an IT working office. <br> This activity is highly beneficial to me as I have never experienced exploring an office like UTM digital. It has sparked motivation in me to work hard so that I will get into a nice office environment and culture like this. Not only that, the features and new technologies I have never seen before in the office have given me inspirations, and also better insights on what potential career paths I can take in the future. <br> I wasn’t too interested in this subject before but after experiencing Industry Visit 1, I find myself looking forward to this subject more because of the activities or assignments it offers that aren’t as mundane as other courses, it is practical and exciting. I hope I can learn more by having fun in similar courses in the future. <br> Video Link <br> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dq5C8PDExWydHJ8A3ihGCFXFyW6USKns?usp=sharing | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Reflection 3 <br> After hearing this talk, I have understood what analytics is and why it plays a crucial role in the work field. The fact that almost everything around us is the results of analytics is fascinating to me and it opens my eyes once I realize how big of an impact it can have on the world. Before this talk, I've never heard of analytics, let alone being interested in it. But now, thanks to the industry talk, I've developed interest in this career and it is a potential career path for me that I would never know about otherwise. I'm thankful to UTM for giving me and other students the opportunity to get exposure on the real work field even when I'm still year 1. |

| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | Reflection Quiz <br> This activity is the one I am looking forward to the most since I have always been interested in PC building but never got experience with it. I am grateful to UTM for granting me this opportunity. I have learned a lot in this activity through the excellent explanation of Professors and assistants. Each step is explained in great details in both disassembling and assembling the PC. The small competition for groups that can assemble the PC at the end is especially fun. There was a quiz after the building session, but it wasn’t hard at all since explanations were given when we were building the PC. The quiz was a great way for me to recall and retain the information and knowledge I learned. I believe I would be able to do this personally in the future thanks to this great learning opportunity.|
