| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | Reflection 1 <br> The speaker who had my full attention and growing enthusiasm to hit the ground running was Mr. Yee. The way he spoke and his enthusiasm made me think of something different, especially when he told me about his wealth of experience and how he managed to reach such a powerful position. He has a big heart. It helps us achieve what we have achieved as quickly as possible and with the least amount of effort. I also learned from this meeting that if you do not start self-learning early, you will face difficulties later. |
