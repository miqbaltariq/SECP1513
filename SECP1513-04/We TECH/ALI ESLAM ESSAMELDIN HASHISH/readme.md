| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Reflection 3 <br>    I’m aiming to become widely knowledgeable about the basics of design thinking and its benefits in my life as a programmer. Also being knowledgeable about technology and information will help a lot in my daily life activities. Design Thinking has greatly changed my view about the technological world we live in today and how it deals with and redefines problems to simplify and understand it, mostly useful for tackling ill-defined or unknown problems we may encounter today. I plan to improve myself over the course months and years to able to reach my goals as a software engineer. I would start and love to start by only focusing on Programming and their supersets to evolve my skills.|
