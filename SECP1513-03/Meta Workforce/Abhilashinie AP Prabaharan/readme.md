Reflection:

Assignment 1(Format:Poster):
This assignment was doing a poster on the overview of ICT jobs in Clarity Techworks.From this assignment i got to know alot of things.Mainly i got to know 
about Android developer,UI/UX designer,QA testing analyst,and web/API developer.To say about our teamwork,working on a poster as a group was a fun and creative 
experience.I loved how we collaborated and bounced ideas off each other.It was great to see how our individual strengths complemented each other and contributed 
to the final result.

Lab(PC Assemble):
For the PC assemble,first i thought it was going to be very hard.But,when my Professor DR Iqbal showed the procedure,Actually it was not hard just that we have to 
remember the procedure by step and understand what are we doing.It was a great experience for me since i can assemble and resemble the PC.We were in a group,and all
of them coorporated well and finally we got to assemblle the PC again and test it.

Design Thinking(prototype):
For this design thinking prototype,i learned alot of new things.I learned all the procedures should be done for a successful project development.We worked in a group
for this project.It was very smooth since all my group mates cooperated really well.The project we developed also was quite interesting and useful.Our project was
related to the Augmented Reality which is very useful for this era.Finally,I would like to thank as well congratulate all my team members for successfully finishing 
our project.

Design Thinking(Format:Report):
My goal is to achieve success in the field of information technology. This project has taught me a great deal. I had the incredible opportunity to dive into various 
phases of project development throughout the project. From here, I learned how to create a project and how to successfully complete it. Furthermore, this project 
provided me with an opportunity to hone my skills in areas such as leadership, communication, and so on. In the future, I will incorporate the lessons I have learned 
throughout the project.
